    I am a highly motivated Software Developer with an unrivaled passion for
    creating stunning and technically elegant web based solutions. Front-end
    preference with back-end/full stack experience and the competency to work
    collaboratively on a vast array of projects. I am happiest working on a team
    to deliver solutions synergistically. Not only do I take great pride in my
    ability to see things from the end user's perspective; I'm also a driven
    learner with the ability to see the big picture, compartmentalize tasks, and
    methodically tackle the project at hand. When a tough opportunity arises, I
    am able to pivot and seek the resources needed to analyze, attain, and
    implement solutions. I am fixated on continuous learning, adaptation, and
    innovation. I manage all aspects of web development, from concept to design,
    development, launch, maintenance, and user support. I enjoy the
    client-facing role and working closely with team members to produce
    high-quality deliverables.
